This project originally started as a proof of concept of the JEE 7 changes that were just released but quickly morphed into a proof of concept for other technologies and projects that I have been interested in trying out.

### JSF ###


### Shiro ###


### JOOQ ###

I have used JDBI and JPA (EclipseLink) to perform the role of persistence manager before and I wanted to experiment with the concept of the Java code using the SQL DSL directly in the code because I actually enjoy writing SQL and agree with the JOOQ author that SQL is the perfect DSL for a SQL data store.
